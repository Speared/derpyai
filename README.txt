Currently takes a bit of setup on the crawl server to work right
	server is hard coded to http://crawl.berotato.org:8080/#lobby at the moment
	you'll need to have a username/password on this server, and enter them into the login.txt file
	set the rc file for the latest version of crawl to have the settings in rc.txt
	
Project takes Python 2.7, Selenium and ChromeDriver to run
Also uses PIL for some debug calls
